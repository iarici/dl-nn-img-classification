# Deep CNN Image Classification with Python

In this project, I have used tensorflow and keras to build a deep CNN that can classify happy and sad people images.

The neural network model consists of convolution, max pooling, dense and flatten layers, using ReLU and sigmoid activation functions and adam compiler. I have also saved the model for further use. The jupyter notebook also includes performance metrics.
